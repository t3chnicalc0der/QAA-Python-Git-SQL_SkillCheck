# This file is testing the functions of controller.py, all functions within this file should be tested. 
# Unit tests are not testing the entire app, just this single function
# When testing you should be using a TEST_DB, to easily do this modify the db.py so it is using a new DB
# When testing on a test_db you should automatically reset the DB after testing and populate it with some data before testing
